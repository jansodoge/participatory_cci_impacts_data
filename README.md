# Data Documentation: Participatory Modelling of Cascading and Compounding Socio-Economic Drought Impacts

This repository contains the data and documentation related to the research paper on participatory modelling of cascading and compounding socio-economic drought impacts. Our focus is on the causal loop diagrams co-created with stakeholders, representing the intricate dynamics of drought impacts on socio-economic systems.

## About the Research

Our research involves the creation and analysis of causal loop diagrams to understand the cascading and compounding effects of socio-economic droughts. These diagrams are developed through participatory modelling interviews with various stakeholders, ensuring a comprehensive and inclusive representation of drought impacts.

## Repository Structure

- `/RawData`: This directory contains the original causal loop diagrams as formulated in the participatory modelling sessions. Each file represents a unique perspective from different stakeholders.

- `/HomogenisedModels`: In this directory, you will find the homogenised models derived from the raw data. These models represent a consolidated and unified version of the causal loop diagrams, integrating insights from various stakeholders.

- `/Documentation`: This folder contains all the necessary documentation for understanding and replicating the homogenisation process. It includes methodological notes, stakeholder meeting summaries, and explanations of the decisions made during the homogenisation process.
